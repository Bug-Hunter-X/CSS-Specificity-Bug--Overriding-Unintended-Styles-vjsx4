To address this, use more general selectors or adjust the specificity.  Here's a solution that improves the code:

```css
.item {
  background-color: blue; /* Default style */
}

#main-container .item:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: red; /* Override for the second item */
}
```

This approach applies a default style to all `.item` elements, then specifically overrides the style for the second item within `#main-container`. This approach ensures better control and predictability.
