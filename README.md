# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS: overly specific selectors overriding unintended styles. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution.  The problem arises from a selector being too precise, affecting only a specific element when a more general style was intended.
